# Spatial Chatter: Engaging Local Multiplayer Communication for Unforgettable Virtual Experiences
This repository will help you get started building a multiplayer experience with the Dolby.io Spatial Chat plugin for Unity.

# Overview
Get started building directly from this template repository by following this [written tutorial](https://dolby.io/blog/spatial-chatter-engaging-local-multiplayer-communication-for-unforgettable-virtual-experiences/).

# Requirements 
- Apple MacOS x64/arm64 or Microsoft Windows 10+ x64.
- A [Dolby.io account](https://dolby.io/). If you do not have an account, you can sign up for a free account.
- The client access token copied from the Dolby.io dashboard. To create the token, log into the Dolby.io dashboard, create an application, and navigate to the API keys section.
- Install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) command line tool on your computer if you wish to install directly using the GitHub link.

# Getting Started 
With the project downloaded, navigate to Unity Hub, select Open, and browse to the project's directory on your local machine. Ensure the project is unzipped before opening it on the game engine. The editor version used for this project is 2021.3.10f1; our SDK works with any Unity version as long as Visual Scripting is installed. Bolt Visual Scripting will continue to support projects on Unity 2018, 2019, and 2020 LTS versions. A good way to check if it is integrated into your project, go to Window > Package Manager and search Visual Scripting in the packages from your project. Otherwise, at the top of the Package Manager window, there will be a "+" button; you will select "Add package by name..." and enter "com.unity.visualscripting". This is also where we will add Dolby.io's spatial chat plugin. In the same "+" button, select instead "Add package from git URL..." and paste this: https://github.com/DolbyIO/comms-sdk-unity.git. 


After it finishes loading, it will show up as DolbyIO Communications version 1.1.1. This is the same location where you could update the plugin in the future as you follow along with future guides from this SDK.
